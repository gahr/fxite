FXiTe, the Free eXtensIble Text Editor, is an advanced text
editor designed to have a feature set similar to the classic
Nirvana Text Editor, aka NEdit. Although NEdit has been around
for years, it still provides some useful features that are
lacking in some newer GUI editors, such as scripting, macro
record/playback, rudimentary ctags and calltip support, and
multi-line regular expressions. FXiTe is an attempt to provide
much of NEdit's utility, while presenting a more modern user
interface. FXiTe also provides some additional features like
syntax-highlighted exporting to PDF or HTML, drag-and-drop tab
reordering, and a built-in "message window" to capture the output
of external commands.

Despite these extra bells-and-whistles, there are still
some important NEdit features currently missing from FXiTe:
multiple-document search-and-replace, word wrap, paragraph
reformatting, and multiple bookmarks, to name a few.

Another design goal of this project was to create a single,
standalone executable program that can be statically linked to
the underlying widget toolkit without the need for additional
libraries and support files. FXiTe uses the Fox GUI toolkit,
the FXScintilla text widget, and the Lua embedded scripting
engine, all of which can be statically linked, but it is also
possible to build FXiTe using dynamic shared libraries for 
these items, in order to produce a smaller compiled binary.

========================= BUILDING ==============================

Building FXiTe on Linux should be fairly straightforward,
provided you meet a few prerequisites -

1. The GNU toolchain (gcc, g++, make, binutils, etc...)
2. A standard Xorg and FreeType installation.
3. The Fox GUI toolkit (minimum 1.6, but 1.7 or later is better)

And of course, you'll need the development headers and libraries
for the items above. Xorg and Freetype are standard on most
modern Linux distributions, and a pre-built Fox toolkit package
is also available for many popular distros.

If you can't find the Fox toolkit in your distro's repositories,
you can download the sources here:

Once you have the required libraries available, building FXiTe
should be as simple as:

  ./configure [options]
  make
  make install

Enjoy!
